# salesforce-lwc-challenge
Created a "AccountList" Lightning Web Component to display a list of Accounts with sorting, pagination, and search functionality. Ensured responsiveness and SLDS adherence, implemented error handling, and provided a button to create new Account records. Demonstrated its compatibility with Lightning page, experience cloud page, and community page.
